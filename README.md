**My Portfolio Website (a rough draft)**

I created this website in under a week to act as a template for my portfolio website; although I learned a lot throughout this process (i.e. drafting my initial design in Figma, reading the Next.JS documentation, and hosting my website through Vercel), I plan on using a professional website builder (WebFlow) to better accomplish my goal of creating a portfolio to share with others. Admittedly, this project is a bit over-engineered, given that my sole purpose was to display static content in an 'aesthetic' manner, but this experience provided me with further insight into different tools/platforms across the web development space (and the appropriate situation to utilize each of them).
